# QuestPresence
Based off of [SwitchPresence](https://github.com/Sun-Research-University/SwitchPresence-Rewritten), you can install QuestPresence to display your VR games in discord.

# Install
It is recommended to install through [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) by manually installing the APK.<br><br>

At the time of writing this application is not released on the sidequest store page but we hoping to put it out there soon:tm:.
